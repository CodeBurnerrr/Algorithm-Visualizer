Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application built with React, TypeScript, Redux, and Tailwind CSS to help users visualize how different sorting algorithms work. This project is perfect for students, educators, and anyone curious about understanding sorting algorithms in an intuitive and fun way.

🚀 Features

🎨 Interactive Visualization: Watch how the algorithms sort arrays step-by-step.

🖥️ Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices and screen sizes.

⚡ Multiple Algorithms: Includes popular sorting algorithms such as:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

🛠️ Customizability:

Adjust the array size.

Change the sorting speed.

Generate new random arrays.

🔄 State Management with Redux: All app states, such as the array data, sorting speed, and algorithm selection, are managed centrally with Redux.

📚 Educational Tool: Perfect for learning the internal workings of sorting algorithms.

🎨 Tailwind CSS Styling: Clean, modern, and responsive design powered by Tailwind CSS.

🔧 Tech Stack

Frontend: React (with TypeScript)

State Management: Redux Toolkit

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Build Tool: Vite (optional, if used) or Create React App

🔧 Usage

Select an Algorithm: Choose the sorting algorithm you want to visualize.

Customize the Array:

Adjust the size of the array using the slider.

Change the sorting speed.

Start Visualization: Click on the "Start" button to watch the sorting process.

Reset or Generate New Array: Click on the "Generate Array" button to reset or create a new array.

🌟 Features Powered by Redux

Centralized State: The array data, sorting algorithm, and speed are all managed globally for better performance and maintainability.

Real-time Updates: Changes in controls instantly reflect in the visualization due to Redux state synchronization.

Extensibility: Easily add new features by extending the Redux store.

🚧 Future Enhancements

Add a graph visualizer for algorithms like A* and Dijkstra.

Display time and space complexity of each algorithm during visualization.

Support for dark mode.
